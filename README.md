Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? 

A significant portion of the code was provided in this project. The code for the structure of the neural network, the maze object and the game functions were all provided.

What code did you create yourself?

The code that I created for this project is the loop which dictates the agents actions and trains the neural network based on the experience gained.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists can use emerging tools like artificial intelligence to solve many of todays most serious problems. This matters because it can result in a improvement in quality of life for many, many people.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I approach a problem by first examining what the inputs to the problem will be and what the desired outputs are. From there, I will try to break the overall goal down into approachable steps. I then tackle the necessary steps starting with the ones that I think I know how to complete and build from there.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists have important ethical responsiblities especially when it comes to artificial intelligence. Most importantly computer scientists have a responsibility to protect the privacy of individuals, and not to misuse their data. Additionally computer scientists have an ethical responsibility not to deploy an artificial intelligence system which will exhibit harmful biases.
